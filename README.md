### Case Study and Student Exercise:
*(same storyline continuedâ€¦)*

Tailwind Traders are DIY, Home and Garden store in and around the London area. The COVID19 pandemic has really shook up the business and priorities, they need deeper insight into where to focus precious time, money and resources in investing in their future. Tailwind traders have employed us as their data science consultant team to help them form a data driven plan for the next financial year.

After the initial feedback sessions sharing the Google Activity data by London Borough, possible IoT architecture solutions and  AI solutions that support operational efficiency and future predictions - the Tailwind Traders team have funded another round of consultancy and investigation work. This time they want to focus on marketing efforts - how do they gain net new customers. 

One option, as they are based primarily in London,  is they want to get in front of new customers whilst they are travelling about their busy days and take a break by stepping into a store or browsing online.

As the new Data Science lead on the project you are tasked with:
* Explore the [Public Transport Journeys by Type of Transport - London Datastore open dataset](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/public-transport-journeys-type-transport) to understand types of journeys people are making around London using Power BI.
* Add a page to the Power BI report shared with Tailwind Traders in round one of investigations
* Recreate the forms recognizer solution for analysing Tailwind Traders receipts and invoices with no-code using AI Builder and build this functionality into a Power App
* BONUS: explore [https://api.tfl.gov.uk](https://api.tfl.gov.uk) to see if you can connect any further transport and activity patterns around London for Tailwind Traders
