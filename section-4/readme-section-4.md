## Section 4: 
Further recommendations will include forecasting and operational efficiency which can be achieved using AI solutions

* Starting with an **Azure Machine Learning code-based solution** to show future forecasting of activity in London boroughs which can help Tailwind Traders make decisions on where to place new stores given the pandemic changes to activity
* Talking about the pro's and con's of using a code-based solution and introducing the **no-code opportunity with AI Builder** as a part of the Power Platform
* **Building a forms recognizer solution** for analysing Tailwind Traders receipts and invoices with no-code (using AI Builder and Power Automate)

## Full Code Example: 
### Azure Machine Learning 

Getting data, training a forecasting model using AutoML technologies, testing the model, deploying it and calling the API.

![Azure Machine Learning Notebook Interface](aml-forecasting.png)

This example uses [sample code available with the Azure ML SDK](https://github.com/amynic/azureml-examples/tree/main/python-sdk/tutorials/automl-with-azureml/forecasting-orange-juice-sales)

You can easily run these examples in Azure Machine Learning:
* Create an Azure Machine Learning Workspace
* Create a compute instance to run the notebook
> [Create ML workspace and resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/quickstart-create-resources)
* Select Notebooks from the left menu
* Then Samples
* Clone any sample and run in the notebook interface easily
